# Mint signup form clone

This is a signup page clone taken from Intuit's Mint. A page that takes as input the email, phone and a password of the user to create an account.

It includes CSS animations and responsive layout with selectors that display important information as popups with transitions for responsive sizes on which those popups couldn't be desplayed properly.

The site was created following the guidelines from the Odin Project https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/forms-for-collecting-data.

It uses HTML and CSS.
